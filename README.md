# IPv6 Training: Fundamentals to Deployment

IPv6 training presentation covering everything from basic concepts to practical deployment strategies for network operators and engineers.

## üìã Overview

This training material provides an exploration of IPv6, designed for network engineers, system administrators, and anyone involved in network infrastructure planning and deployment. The presentation progresses from foundational concepts through to real-world implementation considerations.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this training, participants will be able to:

- Understand the key improvements IPv6 brings over IPv4
- Read, write, and abbreviate IPv6 addresses correctly
- Identify different IPv6 address types and their purposes
- Comprehend IPv6 protocol operations including neighbor discovery and auto-configuration
- Design scalable IPv6 addressing plans for ISP and enterprise networks
- Evaluate and implement appropriate IPv6 transition mechanisms
- Deploy IPv6 in production environments using best practices

## üìö Course Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to IPv6
- Why IPv6? Key improvements over IPv4
- Vastly larger address space (128-bit vs 32-bit)
- Simplified, more efficient packet header
- Address representation and abbreviation rules
- CIDR notation and prefix representation

### Module 2: IPv6 Address Types and Structure
- Overview of address types (Unicast, Multicast, Anycast)
- Global Unicast Addresses (GUA)
- Link-Local addresses and Zone IDs
- Unique Local Addresses (ULA)
- Special-purpose address allocations
- Multicast scope reference
- Modified EUI-64 format and privacy extensions

### Module 3: IPv6 Protocol and Operations
- IPv6 header format and extension headers
- Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)
- ICMPv6 and Neighbor Discovery Protocol
- Address auto-configuration (SLAAC vs DHCPv6)
- Router Advertisement options and flags
- Source address selection algorithm

### Module 4: IPv6 Address Planning
- Shifting mindset: subnets over host counts
- High-level allocation strategy
- ISP infrastructure address planning
- Enterprise and broadband customer allocations
- DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
- Routing plan best practices

### Module 5: IPv6 Transition and Deployment
- Dual Stack implementation
- Overview of transition technologies (6to4, Teredo, DS-Lite, 464XLAT, etc.)
- IPv6-only networks with NAT64/DNS64
- Mobile device support (Android, iOS)
- Phased deployment planning
- Real-world deployment considerations
